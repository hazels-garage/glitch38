# glitch38

just another sweep-alike using ergogen.

## features

* choc vertical spacing, mx horizontal
* 7305 millmax socket support for hotswap switches
* inner thumb rotated 90deg and spaced for 1.5u keycap
* oled
* tenting puck support

## non-reversable
I really dislike how reversable pcbs aren't always symetric.  One mcu might be flipped, oled screen or trrs jack is slightly off.  I'll eventually do a reversable pcb as I get better and can figure out ways to do it a way that doesn't bother me.

## materials
* 2x ProMicro or equivalent
* 2x PJ-320A TRRS Jack
* 2x SSD1306 OLED Screen (optional)
* 38x 1N4148 SOD-123 Diodes
* 38x Kailh Choc v1
* 74x 7305-0-15-15-47-27-10-0 Sockets (optional)
* 36-38x 1u Kailh Choc Keycaps
* 2x 1.5u Kailh Choc Keycaps (optional, for inner thumbs)

## notes
* promicros face up. so they'd be flat against the board if installing without a socket

## firmware
QMK link goes here

## future
* later revisions will likely start to incorporate battery support and then ZMK.
* maybe give choc minis a try
* EVQ encoder support
